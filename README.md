# M-Tree

This is a semestral project from VWM (Searching the Web and Multimedia Databases) on CTU-FIT 
using python3 for an implementation of M-Tree data structure

More about [M-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-tree "M-Tree on wikipedia")

The M-tree structure is generic 
(it supports any kind of data as long as the distance function is defined in the constructor)

* Jan Jeníček (jenicja1@fit.cvut.cz)
* Michal Šolc (solcmich@fit.cvut.cz)

## How to run
```
python3 M-Tree/main.py
```

## GUI app

Main GUI has 4 options:

* Run tester
* Run M-Tree sample app starting with blank M-Tree structure
* Run M-Tree sample app starting with generated M-Tree structure (random)
* Run M-Tree sample app starting with an M-Tree from the last run

### User input 

The sample GUI app only supports 3D tuples of integers as data. Input example:

```
1 1 1
```
